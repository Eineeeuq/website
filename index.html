      <span>Enforcement of Intellectual Property rights</span>
      
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-content">

      <!-- Content for "Enforcement of Intellectual Property rights" -->
     <p><em>Below is an extract of a paper I published on intellectual property rights.</em></p>
      <p>In the era of globalisation, the increase in transnational and internet-related disputes prompt a demand of a universal set of rules governing the cross-border recognition and enforcement of Intellectual Property (‘IP’) rights. The Hague 'Judgments Project', revived in 2011, represents an opportunity to achieve an effective and efficient international circulation of judgments. However, given the ongoing negotiations surrounding its drafting, this writeup examines Australia's stake in the Judgments Project by scrutinising the utilities of having IP judgments included in the scope of the Convention and the jurisdictional issues arising thereof.</p>
      <p>STATUS QUO</p>
      <p>There is a trend in modern IP law development that favours a global recognition and enforcement of foreign IP rights. The demand for a single jurisdiction resolution is found upon the discrepancies in the current international instruments that touch upon the subject matter. Firstly, Article 22(4) of the Brussels I Regulation only assigns exclusive jurisdiction to the court of origin where the IP rights are concerned with registration or validity which are 'deposited or registered'. Not only does this have a limited application on copyright that does not rest its validity on registration, it also leaves the infringement actions alone when there is no issue of validity. Secondly, the Rome II Regulation plainly envisages litigation of foreign IP rights internal to the European Union. While the Berne Convention, the Paris Convention and the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement put heavy focus on IP rights, none specifically address the issue of global recognition and enforcement of IP rights.</p>
      <p>AUSTRALIA'S STAKE IN THE HAGUE JUDGMENTS CONVENTION</p>
      <p>The Hague Conference on Private International Law drew inspiration from the effect of the New York Convention on international arbitration, anticipating that the proposed judgment Convention would achieve a similar circulation effect to court judgments. However, the ambitious attempt was beset by practical challenges and a narrower treaty, namely, the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreement designed in 2005. Whilst the Choice of Court Agreement promotes certainty with the forum selection contractual clauses, it does not necessarily have full force on IP infringement cases as many infringements are not between consensual contract counterparties - not to mention the fact that validity or registration of IP rights seldom involve contractual arrangements. Given Australia's ever-increasing involvement in technological innovation and international trade, it is imminently important to examine if the Judgments Project should encompass IP matters.</p>
      <p>SHOULD IP BE INCLUDED?</p>
      <p>Professional bodies have clearly favoured the inclusion of IP in the Judgments Project for a simplified and managed system of global IP enforcement. European Union is in favour of including IP rights, acknowledging the importance of recognising or enforcing an IP-related judgment in context of an increasing number of cross-border situations. The International Trademark Association supports the inclusion of registered and unregistered trade mark rights, noting that a harmonised enforcement regime would be largely beneficial for brand owners to litigate against globalised trademark infringements enabling them to follow infringers' assets across borders. While opponents argue against the inclusion of IP by placing an emphasis on the territorial nature of IP rights, the Law Council of Australia notes that this reason alone is not sufficient to restrict enforcement or recognition of those rights to the territory, to their creation or to their registration.This is particularly the case when the current draft Convention is based on the 'territoriality principle', where national IP rights (such as patents) are treated equivalently with other IP rights for achieving a harmonising outcome.</p>
      <p>WHICH COURT SHOULD HAVE JURISDICTION OVER IP MATTERS?</p>
      <p>Given the territorial nature of the validity of an IP right, there seems to be an agreement that the validity of a right remain under domestic law. This is due to the fact that the more appropriate forum to examine the validity of an IP right is the country of registration given the local court's expertise on national registration regimes.</p>
      <p>In Australia, the principle in Mocambique and the relative 'act of state' doctrine was relied upon by the High Court in Potter v Broken Hill, where the Court held that a foreign patent is a form of immovable property which could not be determined by the Australian forum and that the grant of patent is an unreviewable territory right. However, it was noted in the later cases that the defendant in Potter raised an argument relating to the validity of the patent which remains beyond the jurisdiction of common law courts. The issue remains if is solely on infringement. In any case, the Court would focus on the inappropriateness of a local court, not the appropriateness or comparative appropriateness of a foreign court. Therefore, a local court should have jurisdiction to hear a IP matter unless the defendant can prove inappropriateness of the forum. In addition, State Courts now has jurisdiction to hear a matter involving title or trespass to foreign land unless it decides that it is not the appropriate court to hear the proceeding.This signals the movement towards an expansion of jurisdiction to hear foreign IP matters, since title of foreign property traditionally remains out of reach of a domestic court. Further, courts have always had jurisdiction under equity to adjudicate a claim for a foreign IP claim given such decision would not be prejudicial to the parties in litigation and any third parties. Whilst later court held that Potter's decision remained in doubt, the modern legal development in this regard presents no legal obstacles for the Australian courts to follow the lead in other jurisdictions and allows itself jurisdiction to hear foreign IP cases under the draft Convention. </p>
      <p>Put simply, a court should have jurisdiction to hear a foreign IP matter pursuant to the current drafting of the Convention, unless a defendant can prove forum non convenien. This provides for the benefits of efficient enforcement against an infringer whose assets are diversified in different jurisdictions, and an enforcer can avoid the need of duplicating the same case across different jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>THE PATH AHEAD</p>
      <p>Should Australia opt in to become a party to the Convention, the legislature will have to amend its domestic law to ensure coherence with the Convention and clarify the pathways of recognising and enforcing foreign judgment for stakeholders. It is not clear whether the resulting domestic regulation would replace or supplement the current Foreign Judgments Act 1991 (Cth) and the proposed International Civil Law Act.[18] Therefore, Australia should be vigilant in ironing out the relationship and complementarity of the new Judgments Project with the existing Choice of Court Convention and any subsequent domestic legal regimes. It should be noted that the sources of Australian jurisdiction and law lies in the Commonwealth, common law, the Constitution, state/territory legislation and specific rules and regulations (including court rules). If the Convention is implemented in Australia, any changes made to the current domestic regime would require extensive consultation with all levels of stakeholders. Amendment at all levels would be essential to give effect to the coherence of the national law and minimise discrepancies.</p>
      <p>As the explanatory note for the project has proclaimed, the commendable objectives of the project would enhance litigants' access to justice; facilitate international trade; and contribute to economic growth of the contracting states.[19] It is now time to tap into the shadowed legislative defects for recognising and enforcing foreign IP judgments.</p>

      <span>Original, Synthetic and Derivative Thinking</span>
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <!-- Content for "Original Synthetic and Derivative Thinking" -->
      <p>Silicon Valley is obsessed with the idea of "original thinking". Wildly contrarian ideas nobody sees coming. Unpopular opinions cloaked in "first principles".</p>
    <p>I think "original thinking" is overrated. When you break problems into their components, each must still be grounded in fundamental truths. It's like solving case problems in law school: you identify each issue, apply relevant rules to facts, then draw a conclusion. But you still need to actually know the rules. Those rules are your fundamental truths. Without them, your "first principles" become empty assumptions.</p>
 <p>There's a better way to think about "original thinking," something Ben Horowitz considers essential to successful entrepreneurship. Labeling any idea as entirely original risks relying on baseless assumptions. Truly original ideas are rare. Humans actually struggle to imagine beyond their existing frame of reference. Think about science fiction: all aliens are imaged based on things we've <I>seen</I>. Most are weirdly anthropomorphic.</p>
 <p>That's why I prefer celebrating "synthetic thinking." Breakthroughs usually come from remixing disciplines, combining known truths in new ways. Pure originality can breed empty conjectures. Synthetic thinkers find patterns, blend ideas, and identify gaps others miss. Like Steve Jobs merging calligraphy and technology to create the Mac.</p>
 <p>This is not to be mistaken as "derivative thinking." Derivative thinkers copy and optimize the status quo without questioning it. They're fast-following startups chasing trends, consultants avoiding risk, and people repackaging what's already popular.</p>
 <p>Synthetic thinkers, though, are here to change things. We don't create from scratch; we remix, reframe, and spot gaps others overlook. In a world full of derivative noise, let's pursue ideas that genuinely make sense. Not just things that are "original". </p>

      <!-- Content for "Pollock moment" -->
      <p>I went to art school before law school. Whenever I overheard general audience commenting on abstract art - especially works like Jackson Pollock - the common refrains were always, "I could've done that."</p>
      <br><img src="https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collection/v1/iiif/482447/1004984/restricted" alt="Pollock" width="150"></li>
      <p>At first, I felt defensive. As painter myself, I thought: honestly, it might be true. Anyone could've done that, right?</p>
      <p>In startups, I noticed an oddly familiar pattern. Once founders start gaining traction, landing press coverage, or achieving milestones, spectators frequently murmur the same thing: "I had that idea years ago. I could've done that."</p>
      <p>But here's the crucial point: they didn't.</p>
      <p>They didn't throw paint on the canvas. They didn't launch the company. They didn't spend nights in anxious uncertainty and looming failure. </p>
      <p>You did.</p>
      <p>Every startup in its early days feels chaotic, uncertain, and sometimes even doomed. Most founders might have looked and felt like walking examples of potential failure. Comfort is rare. Success feels distant, maybe even impossible.</p>
      <p>The essential difference between those who casually dismiss others' success with a dismissive "I could've done that," and those who truly accomplish remarkable things, isn't extraordinary talent or genius.</p>
      <p>It's simply that you took action. You stepped forward. </p>
      <p>There are doers, and there are non-doers. You had every opportunity to choose stability, comfort, and a predictable career. You could have traveled a familiar path.</p>
      <p>But you chose otherwise. You are the doer. You chose to do something uncertain, uncomfortable and difficult, no matter the outcome. </p>
      <p>The choice defines you. That's what makes all the difference.</p>
      <p>That's your Pollock moment.</p>

      <span>Why I Moved ✈️</span>
      
    </div>
    <div class="dropdown-content">

      <!-- Content for "Why I Moved" -->
      <p>I landed at Hong Kong International Airport at 5 a.m. from Sydney, lugging five jars of peanut butter, a rice cooker, three pots, a coffee machine, a sleeping bag, and three suitcases packed with things I thought I'd desperately need. Looking back, I have no idea why my 22-year-old brain thought those things would be hard to find in Hong Kong. But there I was—young, excited, and ridiculously overprepared, ready to start a new chapter in a city that felt like the center of the world.
<p>Julie, my law school friend and I spent that first day at IKEA pulling together a home from secondhand furniture. We slept on the floor on cardboards for two weeks because we didn't have a local phone number to get deliveries. But I didn't care. This was it. I was in the centre of Asia. I'd make partner at a top law firm, build a life here, and maybe, someday, move to New York to become a big-shot lawyer. It felt like I had a roadmap for my entire life. Everything felt possible. </p>
<p>Hong Kong felt like freedom. For the first time, I wasn't an outsider. I was surrounded by people who looked like me—no glass ceilings, no bamboo ceilings. For the first time, I felt like I belonged somewhere.</p>
<p>I threw myself into building a life. My first apartment was in a quiet neighborhood by the sea—far from the hustle and chaos of Central. It reminded me of home: the breeze, the ocean, the families raising kids. I filled it with Taobao treasures, soft carpets, and little decorations that made it feel like home. I even got a cat. Life was good. I thought I'd stay forever.
<p> Then I moved to the centre of the city. My new apartment was amazing, with a balcony overlooking the city. I had so many friends. Too many, honestly. I was always surrounded by people: 40 of us crammed into an apartment celebrating a birthday, a housewarming, a promotion, or someone's admission to practice law. My calendar was always full, my life looked enviable from the outside. But I felt empty. Lonely, even. I couldn't put my finger on why.
 <p>I poured myself into meeting new people and learning new things. But as privileged as this sounds, even that didn't help. The hollow feeling was still there. I was chasing something, but I didn't know what.
 <p>Work wasn't helping either. There were good and bad moments - I secured supreme court orders against billionaires, buried myself in paperwork on NYE, guided the world's leading financial institutions, missed my own birthday party, sleeping a total of 8 hours in a week after 3 consecutive all-nighters to get through to the finish line; funniest of all, was letting out internal screams at the army of cockroaches crawling out from the septic tank of a client's country house, so terrified but still remaining collected as we discuss strategy. I had later picked funds formation as specialty—a niche area of law—because it gave me the mobility to work anywhere in the world. I had to fight to get there, but it was practical. I even passed the New York Bar, my third license to practise law, while working full-time, studying during stolen hours between midnight and dawn. I'd stay up from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m., study until my brain felt fried, then head to work, catch a few hours of sleep, and repeat. It was exhausting, but I thought it was worth it. I had convinced myself that New York was the next logical step.
<p>But as time went on, I started to realize I didn't care about the things I was supposed to care about. My colleagues were brilliant, hardworking, and detail-oriented—everything I thought I admired. But I couldn't bring myself to care about perfect formatting, the debate on oxford comma, or reading the same fee proposal five times. The work felt transactional and detached. I wanted to create something meaningful, but I felt stuck.
<p>After four years, I decided to leave Hong Kong. I packed up 43 boxes of my things (I know), said bye to friends, sublet my apartment, sent away my cat. I wrote a list of cities in the world I thought I'd live in and tried them all - Tokyo, London, Taipei, Beijing, New York - and finally arrived at San Francisco - because of the nature and most importantly, the people. This time, the move felt different. When I landed in Hong Kong, I thought it was where I belonged. When I arrived in San Francisco, I knew it was.</p>
<p>San Francisco has a way of humbling you. It's a city full of people who don't just think outside the box—they shatter it entirely. I thrive here because I love being the dumbest person in the room. Every conversation challenges me to think bigger, learn more, and grow faster. It's terrifying, exhilarating, and exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>Everytime I moved, I moved for opportunities. Moving across three continents in five years taught me a lot—about life, about people, and about my purpose</p>
        <p>What I've Learned</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Only change and yourself are permanent. Everything else is fleeting.
            Each city left its mark on me, but none stayed the same. Neither did I. The peanut-butter-loving 22-year-old who landed in Hong Kong isn't the same person writing this today. I've learned to let go and embrace the impermanence.
        </li>
        <li>Life is an accumulation of choices. You can always choose.
            Moving to Hong Kong was a choice. Staying was a choice. Leaving was, too. Even when I felt stuck, I reminded myself that every day, I was making choices—whether I realized it or not. That realization was liberating.
        </li>
        <li>Belonging isn't about a place—it's about a purpose. In Hong Kong, I searched for belonging in my heritage, my career, and my surroundings. In San Francisco, I learned that belonging comes from being aligned with your purpose and being unapologetically yourself.
        </li>
        <li>Success is fluid. Define it on your own terms. For years, I believed success meant titles, salary, and recognition. But San Francisco showed me that success is about growth, impact, and joy.
        </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Looking back, my journey wasn't just about moving from Sydney to Hong Kong to San Francisco. It was about becoming. Each move was a shedding of one version of myself and the beginning of another. It wasn't always easy. I doubted myself, stumbled, and grieved the lives I left behind. But every step brought me closer to the person I am today: someone who values adventure over certainty, purpose over prestige, and growth over comfort.</p>
         <p>I don't know where I'll go next. Maybe back to Sydney, maybe somewhere completely new. Or maybe I'll finally put down roots. But wherever I end up, I'll carry these lessons with me. And I'll keep choosing, keep growing, and keep chasing that elusive, exhilarating feeling of belonging—not to a place, but to myself.</p>

      <p>When I was a child, a fortune teller (I know) added the Chinese character "绪" to my name because my destiny was said to lack water. It's a detail that sounds quaint and ridiculous now, but it stuck with me, as if water was something I needed to chase my entire life. Later, growing up in Sydney, the ocean became my refuge. I'd run to the cliffs near my house during those bouts of adulescent angst, crying about silly things I can't even remember now. Watching the waves crash against the rocks, I'd feel both tiny and strangely comforted, like the ocean was swallowing my emotions into its vastness.</p>
      <p>But water wasn't always kind to me. A boy once held my head underwater at a swimming pool, and when I came up gasping, the adults told me to let it go. I learned early that my feelings weren't a big deal. As far as I can remember, my hair was cut boyish short because adults deemed braids too much trouble; I grew up in my cousin's hand-me-downs and never had flowy dresses like the other girls.  When I was six, I cried into my pillow at a boarding school I begged to leave. When I was eight, I got slapped for standing up for someone I loved. I was taught to be like water—not in its powerful, unyielding form, but in its gentleness and pliability. A woman, an elderest sister, should be accommodating. My needs came second. Love had to be earned through sacrifice.</p>
      <p>For years, I lived that way. I bent, yielded, and gave until there wasn't much of me left. My job as a lawyer only reinforced that pattern—I let the demands of the role define my worth: how perfect my work was, how smart my boss thought I was, how available, how responsive.</p>
      <p>It all caught up with me when I left my job. Travelling through Asia, floating in a warm saltwater pool, something shifted. It reminded me of the simplicity and peace I once had as a child, before I was taught to sacrifice. </p>
      <p>Ocean, Waves, Water, for me, are no longer symbols of submission. It's a force of nature—strong, relentless, and adaptable. That's the kind of person I want to be. I imagined pulling my five-year-old self out of the pool and telling that boy to bugger off. I pictured my eight-year-old self in long hair, holding my hand.  I felt the reclamation of a part of myself I thought I'd lost. For the first time in years, I felt whole.</p>
      <p>This is why I tattooed waves on my skin—to remind me. It's taught me to let go of the girl I was taught to be and embrace the woman I am. It's shown me that strength lies both in crashing waves and quiet persistence.</p>
      <p>Ocean is where I go when I need to remember who I am. It's where I'll always go to find the strength to keep moving forward. </p>

      <!-- Content for "Finding Purpose" --> 
      <p>To take control of your life, I believe you need to do regular life audits—pausing to ask yourself hard questions about where you are and where you're going. For me, this process revolves around three key principles: coherence, direction, and significance. Is what I'm doing aligned with who I truly am, at my core? Does it reflect my values, my identity, and the things I care about? Does it take me closer to where I want to be in the future, or am I stuck in patterns that lead nowhere? And perhaps most importantly, is what I'm doing meaningful—not just in the sense of personal satisfaction, but in a way that resonates beyond myself, adding value to others and to the world?</p>
 <p>I think life gains its meaning from how well these three elements—coherence, direction, and significance—interact with each other. Coherence gives you the inner peace that comes from knowing your actions reflect your authentic self. Direction gives you the motivation to keep moving forward, even when the path is hard. And significance connects you to something bigger than yourself, reminding you that your efforts matter in the grander scheme of things.</p>
  <p>Without coherence, you feel lost. Without direction, you feel stagnant. And without significance, you feel hollow. But when all three are present, life feels purposeful, even in its challenges. It's not about perfection—it's about living intentionally, in a way that reflects what's most important to you.</p>
