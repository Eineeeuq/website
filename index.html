    <h2>Why I Moved</h2>
    <p>I landed at Hong Kong International Airport at 5 a.m. from Sydney, lugging five jars of peanut butter, a rice cooker, a coffee machine, a sleeping bag, and three suitcases packed with things I thought I’d desperately need. Looking back, I have no idea why my 22-year-old brain thought those things would be hard to find in Hong Kong. But there I was—young, excited, and ridiculously overprepared, ready to start a new chapter in a city that felt like the center of the world.
<p>Julie, my law school friend and I spent that first day at IKEA pulling together a home from secondhand furniture. We slept on the floor on cardboards for two weeks because we didn’t have a local phone number to get deliveries. But I didn't care. This was it. I was in the centre of Asia. I’d make partner at a top law firm, build a life here, and maybe, someday, move to New York to become a big-shot lawyer. It felt like I had a roadmap for my entire life. Everything felt possible. </p>
<p>Hong Kong felt like freedom. For the first time, I wasn’t an outsider. I was surrounded by people who looked like me—no glass ceilings, no bamboo ceilings. For the first time, I felt like I belonged somewhere.</p>

<p>I threw myself into building a life. My first apartment was in a quiet neighborhood by the sea—far from the hustle and chaos of Central. It reminded me of home: the breeze, the ocean, the families raising kids. I filled it with Taobao treasures, soft carpets, and little decorations that made it feel like home. I even got a cat. Life was good. I thought I’d stay forever.

<p> Then I moved to the centre of the city. My new apartment was amazing, with a balcony overlooking the city. I had so many friends. Too many, honestly. I was always surrounded by people: 40 of us crammed into an apartment celebrating a birthday, a housewarming, a promotion, or someone’s admission to practice law. My calendar was always full, my life looked enviable from the outside. But I felt empty. Lonely, even. I couldn’t put my finger on why.

 <p>I poured myself into meeting new people and new experiences, hoping it would fill the void. Over two years, I visited more than 20 countries. From nature to cities, I tried to lose myself in new experiences. But as privileged as this sounds, even that didn’t help. The hollow feeling was still there. I was chasing something, but I didn’t know what.

 <p>Work wasn’t helping either. I had picked funds formation—a niche area of law—because it gave me the mobility to work anywhere in the world. I was not passionate about it and had to fight to get there, but it was practical. I even passed the New York Bar, my third license to practise law, while working full-time, studying during stolen hours between midnight and dawn. I’d stay up from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m., study until my brain felt fried, then head to work, catch a few hours of sleep, and repeat. It was exhausting, but I thought it was worth it. I had convinced myself that New York was the next logical step.

<p>But as time went on, I started to realize I didn’t care about the things I was supposed to care about. My colleagues were brilliant, hardworking, and detail-oriented—everything I thought I admired. But I couldn’t bring myself to care about perfect formatting, the debate between “keep track of” and “keep track with,” or reading the same fee proposal five times. The work felt transactional and detached. I wanted to create something meaningful, but I didn’t know how to make that happen.

<p>After four years, I decided to leave Hong Kong. I wrote a lits of cities in the world I thought I'd live in and tried them all - Tokyo, London, Taipei, Beijing, New York - and finally arrived at San Francisco - because of the nature and most importantly, the people. This time, the move felt different. When I landed in Hong Kong, I thought it was where I belonged. When I arrived in San Francisco, I knew it was.</p>
<p>San Francisco has a way of humbling you. It’s a city full of people who don’t just think outside the box—they shatter it entirely. I thrive here because I love being the dumbest person in the room. Every conversation challenges me to think bigger, learn more, and grow faster. It’s terrifying, exhilarating, and exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>Moving across three continents in five years taught me a lot—about life, about people, and about myself.</p>
<p>What I’ve Learned</p>
    <ul>
<li>Only change and yourself are permanent. Everything else is fleeting.
    Each city left its mark on me, but none stayed the same. Neither did I. The peanut-butter-loving 22-year-old who landed in Hong Kong isn’t the same person writing this today. I’ve learned to let go and embrace the impermanence.
</li>
<li>Life is an accumulation of choices. You can always choose.
    Moving to Hong Kong was a choice. Staying was a choice. Leaving was, too. Even when I felt stuck, I reminded myself that every day, I was making choices—whether I realized it or not. That realization was liberating.
</li>
<li>Belonging isn’t about a place—it’s about a purpose. In Hong Kong, I searched for belonging in my heritage, my career, and my surroundings. In San Francisco, I learned that belonging comes from being aligned with your purpose and being unapologetically yourself.
</li>
<li>Success is fluid. Define it on your own terms. For years, I believed success meant titles, salary, and recognition. But San Francisco showed me that success is about growth, impact, and joy.
</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Looking back, my journey wasn’t just about moving from Sydney to Hong Kong to San Francisco. It was about becoming. Each move was a shedding of one version of myself and the beginning of another. It wasn’t always easy. I doubted myself, stumbled, and grieved the lives I left behind. But every step brought me closer to the person I am today: someone who values adventure over certainty, purpose over prestige, and growth over comfort.</p>
 <p>I don’t know where I’ll go next. Maybe back to Sydney, maybe somewhere completely new. Or maybe I’ll finally put down roots. But wherever I end up, I’ll carry these lessons with me. And I’ll keep choosing, keep growing, and keep chasing that elusive, exhilarating feeling of belonging—not to a place, but to myself.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="purpose">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>To take control of your life, I believe you need to do regular life audits—pausing to ask yourself hard questions about where you are and where you’re going. For me, this process revolves around three key principles: coherence, direction, and significance. Is what I’m doing aligned with who I truly am, at my core? Does it reflect my values, my identity, and the things I care about? Does it take me closer to where I want to be in the future, or am I stuck in patterns that lead nowhere? And perhaps most importantly, is what I’m doing meaningful—not just in the sense of personal satisfaction, but in a way that resonates beyond myself, adding value to others and to the world?</p>
    <p>I think life gains its meaning from how well these three elements—coherence, direction, and significance—interact with each other. Coherence gives you the inner peace that comes from knowing your actions reflect your authentic self. Direction gives you the motivation to keep moving forward, even when the path is hard. And significance connects you to something bigger than yourself, reminding you that your efforts matter in the grander scheme of things.</p>
    <p>Without coherence, you feel lost. Without direction, you feel stagnant. And without significance, you feel hollow. But when all three are present, life feels purposeful, even in its challenges. It’s not about perfection—it’s about living intentionally, in a way that reflects what’s most important to you.</p>

            <section id="why-water">
    <h2>Why Water is Special</h2>
    <p>TWater has always been a constant in my life, woven into my most formative experiences, my deepest struggles, and my moments of clarity. It’s been a source of both pain and healing, a mirror reflecting everything I’ve tried to bury and everything I aspire to be.
    <p>When I was a child, a fortune teller (I know) added the Chinese character “绪” to my name because my destiny was said to lack water. It’s a detail that sounds quaint now, but it stuck with me, as if water was something I needed to chase my entire life. Later, growing up in Sydney, the ocean became my refuge. I’d run to the cliffs near my house during those bouts of teenage angst, crying about things I can’t even remember now. Watching the waves crash against the rocks, I’d feel both tiny and strangely comforted, like the ocean was swallowing my sadness into its vastness.</p>
    <p>But water wasn’t always kind to me. There was the day in the swimming pool when a classmate held my head underwater, and I came up gasping, only to be told by adults to let it go, that it wasn’t a big deal. There were the endless lessons in endurance: my hair cut short because long braids were deemed too much trouble, nights spent crying alone at a boarding school where I begged to go home, and the slap across my face when I tried to stand up for someone close to me because of someone else's betrayal. I was 8. Growing up, I was taught to be like water—not in its powerful, unyielding form, but in its gentleness and pliability. I was told that a woman should be accommodating, that my needs came second to others’, and that love had to be earned through sacrifice.</p>
    <p>For years, I lived like that. I bent, I yielded, and I gave, until there wasn’t much of me left. My job as a lawyer only reinforced that pattern. I let the demands of the role define my worth: how available I was, how responsive I could be. My ex broke up with me in the same month I left that toxic job, and both felt like endings I had been too scared to choose for myself.</p>
    <p>It all caught up with me when I went to Bali. There, in a warm saltwater pool, floating like I was back in my mother’s womb, I felt something shift. The water didn’t just cradle me; it forced me to confront myself. For the first time, I saw them clearly. I wasn’t angry at myself for my weakness anymore. I was angry because the people who should have protected me hadn’t. That saltwater pool became a place of rebirth. It reminded me of the simplicity and peace I once had as a child, before I learned to self-betray and self-sacrifice. From that moment, I decided to be my own protector, my own mother. I would stop taking responsibility for others’ failures and start showing up for myself.</p>
    <p>Water, for me, is no longer a symbol of submission. It’s a force of nature—strong, relentless, and adaptable. It wears down mountains and shapes landscapes. That’s the kind of woman I want to be. I remember visualizing myself holding hands with my eight-year-old self in a long dress, and with the five-year-old me, pulling her out of the pool and telling the boy who pushed her to bugger off. I felt power in that moment, reclaiming a part of myself I thought I’d lost.</p>
    <p>This is why water is so special to me. So sepcial, I tattoo-ed waves on myself to remind me forever. It’s taught me to let go of the “good girl” I was taught to be and embrace the wild woman I am becoming. It’s shown me that strength isn’t just in crashing waves but in the quiet persistence of a river carving its way through rock. It’s given me clarity, a sense of peace, and the courage to rewrite my own story.</p>
    <p>Water is where I go when I need to remember who I am. It’s where I’ll always go to find the strength to keep moving forward.</section>
